# HARE CHALLENGE

To construct a robot and program it to travel the given track(for this year it will be straight and go 30 feet and the robot must return to the start) as fast as possible. The fastest robot wins!


## Requirements:
1. Must keep an engineering notebook(instructions follow)
2. Must plan!!!! You will find that this is very helpful - each person will do this individually
3. Only 2 motors allowed on the vehicle
4. Use small wheels or friction wheels only - no omni directional wheels
5. No cutting of any structure pieces
6. Must gear your robot
7. Must calculate your gear ratio
 

## Use the concepts from the gear lesson we just completed:
- What gear ratio should you use? 
- Simple or compound gearing
- What happens to torque when you have a high gear ratio?  


### Gear Sizes in our vex kits:
- 12T gears
- 36T gears
- 60T gears
- 84T gears

## Engineering Notebook Outline

**You can create this as a partnership or individually. Some parts are individual though!!**

**Observe:** Research, look at what constraints you have and the supply list. Give details of what you found/learned/are going to apply to the project.

**Define the Problem:** What is the actual problem you are solving.

**Brainstorm:** individually come up with your ideas and then collaborate. Create a drawing of your idea and know what you need to build. You will probably need to visit the robot cabinet several times throughout the planning process. Diversity of ideas is how we create something great. Remember no idea is a bad idea!! Be respectful of each other as you go through this process. Put in the math used for your gearing ratios here to show your idea fully. Why are you using the wheels that you chose?

**Compare:** Compare the designs and decide which you think will work best. Record and tell why you chose that design and how it is the best design. If you choose to redesign include any math and sketches of the redesign here..

**Make:** Create your prototype/final product. Take pictures and describe what we are seeing and why it is important. Give a final gear ratio calculation here.

**Repeat:** Record changes you make, new sketches etc. 

**Robot Reflection (individual):** What did you learn? What were your challenges, how did you overcome them. Reflect on your growth in coding, what did you learn, how did you apply it? Reflect on your growth in your building/design process. What will you take from this project?

**After testing the Robot:**
- How well did it accomplish the tasks?
- What areas did it do well?
- What areas did it struggle?
- If you could go back what changes would you make to your coding?
- If you could go back what changes would you make to your chassis?

**Video:** Create a video explaining your robot design and then completing the track. Give your fastest completion time. Since I am not going to be there this will be the way that I get to see what you did and help in the grading process. Make it a detailed video. You will put the video in your google drive and then link to it in your Engineering Notebook.
